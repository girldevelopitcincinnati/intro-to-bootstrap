## Course description

Bootstrap, an open-source front-end framework, is one of most popular of its kind for building responsive, mobile-friendly projects on the web. Composed of flexible HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components, it allows designers and developers of all skill levels to launch beautiful, fully-functional websites quickly. The best part: it’s completely free to download and use!
